# Spoolman Setup Guide

## Add Extra Fields

Spoolman needs two custom extra fields on spools to work with this system.

1. Go to your Spoolman UI (e.g. `http://YOUR_SPOOLMAN_IP:7912`)
2. Go to **Settings → Extra Fields → Spool**
3. Add the following fields:

### Field 1: NFC ID
- **Key:** `nfc_id`
- **Name:** `nfc_id`
- **Field Type:** Text
- **Order:** 1

### Field 2: Active Toolhead
- **Key:** `active_toolhead`
- **Name:** `active_toolhead`
- **Field Type:** Text
- **Order:** 2

## Register NFC Tags on Spools

For each spool:

1. Scan the NFC tag with one of your toolhead readers
2. Check the middleware logs — you'll see:
   ```
   No spool found in Spoolman for UID: XX-XX-XX-XX
   ```
3. Note the UID
4. Go to Spoolman → find or create your spool
5. Edit the spool and enter the UID in the `nfc_id` field

> **Note:** Spoolman stores the nfc_id with extra quotes internally. The middleware handles this automatically by stripping them during comparison.

## Low Spool Warning

The LED breathing effect and low spool warning require Spoolman to track filament usage **by weight in grams**. If a spool is only tracking by length (meters), the middleware cannot read `remaining_weight` and the warning will never fire.

To enable weight-based tracking:

1. Go to Spoolman → **Filaments**
2. Find the filament type used by the spool
3. Edit it and set **Spool Weight** — this is the weight of a full new spool in grams (e.g. `1000` for a 1kg spool)
4. Go to Spoolman → **Spools**
5. Edit the spool and set **Used Weight** to reflect how much has been used, or set **Remaining Weight** directly

Once `spool_weight` is set on the filament profile, Spoolman will calculate and return `remaining_weight` in grams. The middleware compares this against `LOW_SPOOL_THRESHOLD` (default: 100g) and triggers the breathing LED effect if the spool is at or below that level.

> **Note:** If your spool is showing remaining length in meters instead of grams in Mainsail or Fluidd, this means `spool_weight` is not set on the filament profile. Set it and the display will switch to grams.

## Moonraker Integration

Add the following to your `moonraker.conf`:

```ini
[spoolman]
server: http://YOUR_SPOOLMAN_IP:7912
sync_rate: 5
```

Then restart Moonraker:
```bash
sudo systemctl restart moonraker
```
